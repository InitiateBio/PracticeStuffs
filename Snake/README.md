# SNAKE!!!!

This repository is broken down as such:
StudioFiles is everything you need to make changes and have fun with the code.
The Snake.cs file can simply be compiled after you copy and paste it somewhere. 

Remember to consider Classes, Namespaces, Functions, Etc that was in the videos on the main repository.

I tried to comment as much as possible to keep to readable, If you have any improvements please share!!
