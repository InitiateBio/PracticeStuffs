# PracticeStuffs

Here's some fun codes! 
You will need visual studio code https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ (or avail in the appstore)
I will update these as I have time, so check back, and feel free to add stuffs! 

The goal is a "framework" where people can practice reading code, and fill in the blanks for a product to debug and enjoy! 

I will branch different frameworks from main, and you can go from there!! 

Here is some helpful links: (I believe Studio accepts C, C++, C#, and Python) 
I am teaching the kids C#, my preference, so i'll just share the C# reference.

C# Reference:
